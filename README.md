## How to navigate this project  
- The `root`folder of the project two separate folders, one is `client`, which contains all code for the frontend part of the project, and the root folder which contains the backend code.
- the `client` `src` folder is broken down into:
		- `assets` - contains all images used by the app
		- `components` - all reusable components of the web app
		- `firebase` - firebase configuration and utils
		- `redux` - redux reducers, actions, sagas
- The project uses SCSS and styled-components for the overall look of the frontend part of the app. [Example of the cart dropdown component](https://github.com/obleey/crwn-clothing/blob/main/client/src/components/cart-dropdown/cart-dropdown.styles.jsx)
- Redux logic is broken down into folders for each part of the app: [See shop folder with all Redux logic](https://github.com/obleey/crwn-clothing/tree/main/client/src/redux/shop)
- All separate pages are found [here](https://github.com/obleey/crwn-clothing/tree/main/client/src/pages). The app uses React-router-dom

## If I had more time I would change this  
- Write all tests using Jest
- Since I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymore, i would implement GraphQL (which i did [here](https://github.com/obleey/crwn-clothing-graph-ql) ) or  react-query for data managment.
- use a CSS framework like TailwindCSS or MaterialUI
