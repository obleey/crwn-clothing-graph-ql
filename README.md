## How to navigate this project  

- the `src` folder is broken down into:
		- `App` - whole app and app container moved to 	  it's own folder
		- `assets` - contains all images used by the app
		- `components` - all reusable components of the web app
		- `firebase` - firebase configuration and utils
		- `graphql` - all graphQL utils and setup
		- `pages` - application pages
		- `redux` - redux reducers, actions, sagas. All data managment logic is replaced with GraphQL in this repository
- The project uses SCSS and styled-components for the overall look of the frontend part of the app. [Example of the cart dropdown component](https://github.com/obleey/crwn-clothing-graph-ql/blob/main/src/components/cart-dropdown/cart-dropdown.styles.scss)
- GraphQL logic is found [here](https://github.com/obleey/crwn-clothing-graph-ql/tree/main/src/graphql)
- All separate pages are found [here](https://github.com/obleey/crwn-clothing-graph-ql/tree/main/src/pages). The app uses React-router-dom for page navigation

## If I had more time I would change this  
- Write all tests using Jest
- Try implementing React-query for data management, upgrade react-router-dom to v6 or maybe replace it with React-location
- use a CSS framework like TailwindCSS or MaterialUI
